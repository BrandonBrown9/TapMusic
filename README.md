# TapMusic

# MusicApp Based on DevEd

This vanilla JS project is based on Developed By Ed's Tap Music Application.
I plan to use this code and turn it into a react app, to wet my feet with beginning to learn react and develop my MERN Stack.

# Current Feature Set

This app currently has 6 different colors to click.
Once clicked, the element will play a sound. It will also create an element that has an animation.
Once the animation ends, the element is removed.

# Future Feature Set

Import React.
Move the colors up and add space between them.
Create grid-like pattern, up to 18 elements.
Add more sounds.
Remove ball animation.
Add pulse animation to the clicked element.
